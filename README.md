#RockSmash

'Rock Smash' was my first ever project, a simple JS/jQuery game for the browser. The game builds on the classic 'Duck Hunt', with the extra difficulty being in having to destroy rocks in numerical order.

I also added the ability to change the speed and play two players. Future versions will fix bugs, make the site more responsive and mobile friendly.

###Built With...

- HTML/CSS
- CSS Animations

- It was here I started to appreciate the power of StackOverflow for finding useful code snippets
